Hello friend! Welcome to my little corner of the web. I've just rebuilt this site for [#May1Reboot](http://www.may1reboot.com/). I hope you like what I've put together.

Let me introduce myself. I'm a self-taught freelance developer living in Ottawa, ON. I'm also studying computer science at Carleton University. My greatest loves in life are [Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVpLCnpuUYA), good coffee, and coding. With any luck, most of my future blog posts will discuss these topics more in depth. If that sounds like something you would be interested in reading, then you can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jayden_windle) to get notified when I post new things.

Anyhow, thanks for stopping by! If you have any feedback about the new design, or if you like my work and want to work together, feel free to send me a [message]({{"/contact" | prepend: site.baseurl}}).
