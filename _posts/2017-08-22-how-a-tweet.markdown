If you had asked me three months where I thought I would be now, there’s no way I would have said Silicon Valley. I would have said something along the lines of “Oh, you know, back to school for the fall” or maybe “working as an intern at XYZ company”.

It’s always been my dream to move to Silicon Valley. As a self-taught developer and entrepreneur who grew up in a rural community, the image of a city where the brightest minds in the world come to learn and build the future has always drawn me in like a magnet. It’s a far cry from the farmer’s fields, redneck trucks, and obscene deer population that characterized my hometown. Whenever I thought of the Valley I felt a little spark of excitement and opportunity. But I never thought I’d have a shot at that dream this soon.

Some part of me has always thought of that dream as a near impossibility — a pipe dream if you will. I thought that *maybe* after I finished university and had worked for a couple of years I *might* have a shot at working in the Valley. As much as I subscribe to the growth mindset school of thought, sometimes my heart thinks a bit louder than my head. I’m working on that.
A few months ago I was scrolling through twitter (like any developer does when they’re procrastinating) and I came across this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Favorite this tweet if you know how to write code well.<br><br>I&#39;m then going to message and pitch you on joining Full Tilt companies ;)</p>&mdash; Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) <a href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/862477102783885314">May 11, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

It was simple, but it caught my attention. For a second, I felt that spark of a dream inside me. Maybe this was my chance. So I hit like. What the hell, right?

Anthony and I went back and forth for a bit, and he was very kind to introduce me to a few of the Full Tilt founders. But after chatting with them it didn’t seem like any of them were super keen on hiring me. Or maybe I’m just bad at following up, who knows.

So I went back to my typical life — working 9–5, working on side projects in the evenings, spending time with friends. I almost completely forgot about that interaction.

Then one day I woke up to a cold email in my inbox. It didn’t even have my name in the email, so I thought at first that it was spam.

It looked like this:

> Hi — I’m currently a student at Stanford Business School and just launched a startup on called Jetpack. Jetpack uses social networks and human interactions to make consumer products available in real time — less than 15 minutes! … We’re looking for someone to join our founding team here in the valley. We’ve already seen the potential for this to be major and have been seeing steady growth. Your profile really stood out to me and I figured it’s be at least worth a conversation!

I was very skeptical at first. Rightfully so — I’ve lost count of how many times foreign princes have emailed offering me a share of their limitless riches. But that spark was there again; a voice in my head saying “Maybe this is your shot!”

So I responded with the only thing I could think of at the time.

> Thanks for reaching out. I’d love to chat about Jetpack some time!

What the hell, right?

About five minutes later, Fatima emailed me back. Then we Skyped a few times. She laid out the vision for Jetpack and told me a bit about what they were planning on building. I fell in love with the idea — I know that I would have used it daily if I had access to it on my campus. Her passion and drive were incredible. 

When we first Skyped, I asked Fatima how she had managed to find me. I was a college student in Ottawa, Canada and had never even had my 5 minutes of fame (ok, besides that one time my picture was in the local newspaper because I won a public speaking competition in 3rd grade. That’s small town life for you).

She told me the very long string of events that had lead her to my website. She was reading an article that Anthony had written, and decided to read through his twitter (like any entrepreneur does when they’re procrastinating). She saw the back-and-forth between him and I, and went to my profile and then my website. “We were looking for some technical talent, and your portfolio looked great. So I figured what the hell, right?”

Here’s the takeaway — putting yourself out there is huge, both for individuals and companies. It doesn’t take much — I had a really simple website set up, and all I did was like a tweet. Fatima sent a quick email. Now I’m on the way to living my dream and Jetpack found a really great developer for their team. Crazy things happen when you put yourself out there and the internet does it’s thing.

Eventually Fatima dropped the question — “Do you want to move down to California and come work with us?”

I’m not naive — I’ve had tons of people tell me that most startups fail and that the Valley is the most expensive place to live and that it will crush my dreams and empty my bank account. I know the risks. 

But my dream of moving to the Valley has never been motivated by the desire for money or fame or luxury. I just love building cool stuff with other smart people that makes a positive change in the world. 

So, I said yes. 

What the hell, right?
