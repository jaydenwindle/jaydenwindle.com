# Portfolio Website

This repo holds all the code for my portfolio website. 

Feel free to use it as the base for your own site, license is [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Be forewarned though, it is not compatible with GitHub pages (due to the use of jekyll-bootstrap-sass and jekyll-babel plugins). PRs to remove those dependencies are welcome :)
